The README is for Programming Project 1, _assignment_1.py_

* **Save the document**\
For the three files in _pp1data.zip_, store in  _'pp1data/'_. You can replace the route as the _base_dir_ in _main_4_experiments()_.  


* **Correspond Arguments**\
For 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 sections in _pp1.pdf_, the correspond functions are main_3_1(), main_3_2(), main_3_3(), main_3_4()


* **Execute Experiments**\
To execute the experiments in _pp1.pdf_, simply execute _assignment_1.py_ (ex: python3 assignment.py). Then _main_4_experiments(base_dir)_ will be executed.
Note that you have to locate in the same file where _assignment_1.py_ is stored when you are going to execute it.


* **The Results**\
For each experiment and each file (amazon, imbd, yelp), the model will create a csv file and a html file.
The former records the mean and standard deviation of accuracy, the latter is the plot required in _pp1.pdf_.
The names of the files start with their original file name, ex: _yelp_labelled_smoothing_parameter.csv_
